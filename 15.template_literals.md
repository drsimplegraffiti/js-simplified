### Template Literals

- Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions.

```js
let bunny_name = 'Peter';
let bunny_color = 'white';
// old way
console.log(
  "My bunny's name is " + bunny_name + ' and his color is ' + bunny_color
);

// new way
console.log(`My bunny's name is ${bunny_name} and his color is ${bunny_color}`);
```
