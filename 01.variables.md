### Variables in JavaScript

#### Variables are containers for storing data values.

> In this example bunny is a variable, "bunny" is the value of the variable, and "string" is the data type.

```js
var bunny = 'lucy';
var dog = 'Tom';
var cat = 'Molly';
```

### Variable Naming Rules

- JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

- JavaScript uses the keyword var to declare variables.

- The equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

- The semicolon ends the statement.

- JavaScript is case sensitive. This means that bunny and Bunny are different variables.

- JavaScript variables must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.

#### Acceptable naming conventions

```js
var bunny = 'lucy';
var _bunny = 'lucy';
var $bunny = 'lucy';
```

#### Unacceptable naming conventions

```js
var 1bunny = 'lucy';
var -bunny = 'lucy';
var @bunny = 'lucy';
```

### Variable Declarations

#### JavaScript has three types of variable declarations:

- var
- let
- const

### When to use the three types of variable declarations

#### var

- Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

- The scope of a variable declared with var is its current execution context, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared outside any function, global.

- Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and are initialized with a value of undefined.

#### let

- Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

- The scope of a variable declared with let is the block in which it is declared, which can be smaller than the containing function.

- Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their scope but are not initialized. They are in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.

#### const

- Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

- The scope of a constant declared with const is the block in which it is declared, which can be smaller than the containing function.

- Constants cannot be declared in the same block as a let or var variable with the same name.

- Constants cannot be declared with the same name as a function or a variable in the same block.

- Constants cannot be redeclared or reassigned.

- Constants must be assigned an initial value.

### Variable Scope

#### JavaScript has two types of scope:

- Local scope

- Global scope

#### Local scope

- Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

- Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.

- Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

#### Code sample

```js
function animalName() {
  var bunny = 'lucy'; // Local variable
  console.log(bunny);
}
```

#### Global scope

- A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

- A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.

- Global variables are created when you assign a value to them.

- Global variables are deleted when you close the page.

#### Code sample

```js
var bunny = 'lucy'; // Global variable
function animalName() {
  console.log(bunny);
}
```

### Exercises

1. Create a variable called `bunny` and assign it the value of your bunny's name.

2. Use the `let` keyword to declare a variable called `dog` and assign it the value of your dog's name.
