### Classes in Javascript

- Classes are a template for creating objects.

#### Example of class declaration:

```javascript
class Bunny {
  constructor(name, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
  }
}
```

- `class` keyword is used to declare a class.
- `constructor` is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.
- `this` keyword refers to the object itself.

#### Example of creating an object from a class:

```javascript
let bunny = new Bunny('Peter', 'white');
```

- `new` keyword is used to create an object from a class.

#### Example of class declaration with methods:

```javascript
class Bunny {
  constructor(name, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```

- `speak` is a method of the class `Bunny`.

#### Example of creating an object from a class with methods:

```javascript
let bunny = new Bunny('Peter', 'white');
bunny.speak();
```

- `bunny.speak()` is a method call.

#### Example of class declaration with static methods:

```javascript
class Bunny {
  constructor(name, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}`);
  }

  static info() {
    console.log('This is a bunny class');
  }
}
```

- `static` keyword is used to create a static method.

#### Example of creating an object from a class with static methods:

```javascript
let bunny = new Bunny('Peter', 'white');
