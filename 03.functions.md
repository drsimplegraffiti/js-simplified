### Javascript Functions

- Functions are a set of statements that perform a task or calculates a value.

- Functions are executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Example of function declaration:

```javascript
// sum up the total bunnies in a farm
function sumBunnies() {
  var blackBunnies = 10;
  var whiteBunnies = 20;
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  return totalBunnies;
}
```

- The function above is called `sumBunnies` and it has no parameters.

- The function above returns the value of `totalBunnies`.

- The function above is called by using the function name followed by parentheses.

Example of function invocation:

```javascript
sumBunnies();
```

Let's write the function and invoke it in the console:

```javascript
function sumBunnies() {
  var blackBunnies = 10;
  var whiteBunnies = 20;
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  return totalBunnies;
}

sumBunnies();
// result: 30
```

- The function above will return the value of `totalBunnies` which is `30`.

---

### The above function can be rewritten as an anonymous function

```javascript
var sumBunnies = function () {
  var blackBunnies = 10;
  var whiteBunnies = 20;
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  return totalBunnies;
};

sumBunnies();
```

---

### Function Parameters

- Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

#### Example

```javascript
function sumBunnies(blackBunnies, whiteBunnies) {
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  return totalBunnies;
}

sumBunnies(10, 20);

// result: 30
```

- The function above is called `sumBunnies` and it has two parameters: `blackBunnies` and `whiteBunnies`.

- The function above returns the value of `totalBunnies`.

- The function above is called by using the function name followed by parentheses.

---

### Function Return

- The `return` statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.

- The `return` value of the function is "returned" back to the "caller":

---

### Arrow Functions

- Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing function expressions.

##### Example of arrow function

```javascript
var sumBunnies = (blackBunnies, whiteBunnies) => {
  // the => is called the fat arrow
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  return totalBunnies;
};

sumBunnies(10, 20);
// result: 30
```

---

### IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
These are functions that are executed as soon as they are defined.

```javascript
(function () {
  var blackBunnies = 10;
  var whiteBunnies = 20;
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  console.log(totalBunnies);
})();
```
