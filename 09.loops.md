### Loops and Iterations

Loops and Iteration are a way to repeat a block of code until a condition is met.

#### For Loop

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // As long as i is less than 10, keep running the code
  console.log(`Number ${i}`);
}
```

#### While Loop

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  // As long as i is less than 10, keep running the code
  console.log(`Number ${i}`);
  i++;
}
```
