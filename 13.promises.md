### Promises in JavaScript

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

> Asynchronous operations are operations that do not happen immediately. For example, making an API call to a server.

#### Promises can be in one of three states:

- Pending
- Resolved
- Rejected

#### Example of a Promise

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (true) {
    resolve('Stuff worked');
  } else {
    reject('Error, it broke');
  }
});
```

> In the above code, the `promise` variable is a new Promise. The `Promise` constructor takes a function as a parameter. The function takes two parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. The `resolve` function is called when the promise is resolved. The `reject` function is called when the promise is rejected.

#### Example of a Promise with a `then`and catch` method

```js
// promises
const getTodos_ = () => {
  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    // .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((err) => console.log(err));
};

getTodos_();
```

> In the above code, the `getTodos_` function is a function that makes an API call to the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos` endpoint. The `fetch` function returns a promise. The `then` method is called when the promise is resolved. The `catch` method is called when the promise is rejected.

#### Example of a Promise with `async` and `await`

```js
// async await
const getTodos = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
  const data = await response.json();
  //   console.log(data);
  return data;
};

getTodos();
```

> In the above code, the `getTodos` function is a function that makes an API call to the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos` endpoint. The `async` keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. The `await` keyword is used to wait for a promise to be resolved. The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function.
