### Exception Handling

These are ways of handling errors in your code. They allow you to catch errors and handle them in a way that makes sense for your application.

#### Examples

##### Throw statement

```js
function sumBunnies(blackBunnies, whiteBunnies) {
  if (typeof blackBunnies !== 'number' || typeof whiteBunnies !== 'number') {
    throw new Error('blackBunnies and whiteBunnies must be numbers');
  }
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  return totalBunnies;
}

sumBunnies(10, 20);

// result: 30
```

> In the above code, If the `blackBunnies` and `whiteBunnies` parameters are not numbers, the function will throw an error.

---

##### Try Catch statement

```js
function sumBunnies(blackBunnies, whiteBunnies) {
  if (typeof blackBunnies !== 'number' || typeof whiteBunnies !== 'number') {
    throw new Error('blackBunnies and whiteBunnies must be numbers');
  }
  var totalBunnies = blackBunnies + whiteBunnies;
  return totalBunnies;
}

try {
  sumBunnies(10, 20);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

> In the above code, the `try` block will try to execute the code inside it. If an error is thrown, the `catch` block will catch the error and execute the code inside it.
